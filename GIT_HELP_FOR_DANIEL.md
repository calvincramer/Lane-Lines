# COMMANDS THAT YOU CAN USE FOR GIT

## SEE LOCAL CHANGES, SEE CURRENT BRANCH
`git status`

## SEE ALL BRANCHES
`git branch -a`

## ADD FILES TO GIT
### MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE ROOT DIRECTORY OF THE PROJECT, OR ELSE CHANGES FROM ANOTHER FOLDER AT THE SAME LEVEL WILL NOT BE ADDED
`git add .`

## MOVE TO A NEW BRANCH
## BE CAREFUL SINCE IT WONT ALLOW YOU TO SWITCH TO ANOTHER BRANCH IF YOU HAVE ANY CHANGES	
`git checkout <branchname>`
### FORCE MOVE TO ANOTHER BRANCH, THIS WILL DELETE YOUR WORK ON THE CURRENT BRANCH
`git checkout -f <branchname>`

## CREATE ANOTHER BRANCH
## FIRST CHECKOUT TO THE BRANCH YOU WANT TO BRANCH FROM, USUALLY SHOULD BE MASTER
```
git checkout master
git branch <newbranchname>
```

## PULL CHANGES FROM GITHUB (REMOTE)
`git pull`
Usually will be
`git pull origin master`

## COMMIT LOCAL CHANGES LOCALLY
`git commit -m "Put a message here briefly explaining what changes you made"`

## PUSH YOUR COMMITTED CHANGED TO GITHUB (REMOTE)
`git push origin <branchname>`
### MAKE SURE TO PUSH YOUR COMMITS TO THE BRANCH YOU ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON
### IF YOU ON ARE ON THE MASTER BRANCH IT WILL BE:
`git push origin master`

## NORMAL WORKFLOW:
### START TO WORK, PULL MOST RECENT VERSION FROM GITHUB:
`git pull`
### CHECKOUT TO THE BRANCH YOU WANT TO WORK ON:
`git checkout <branchname>`
### DO SOME WORK....
### DONE WITH WORK, NOW SAVE CHANGES TO GITHUB:
```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push origin <branchname>
```

### THEN GO TO THE GITHUB PAGE AND VERIFY THE CHANGES WERE MADE

## FOR PULL REQUESTS AND REVIEWS, USE GITHUB

## FOR MERGING BRANCHES, IF THERER ARE MERGE CONFLICTS AND WE CANNOT MERGE AUTOMATICALLY FROM GITHUB, DO THIS
### MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON THE BRANCH YOU WANT TO MERGE
```
git checkout <branchname>
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
```

### NOW THERE WILL BE MERGE CONFLICTS THAT YOU NEED TO RESOLVE,
### GO INTO THE FILES IT SAYS THERE ARE MERGE CONFLICTS AND CHOSE WHICH VERSION YOU WANT FOR EACH CONFLICT
### AFTER THOSE ARE RESOLVED IT SHOULD BE READY TO MERGE AUTOMATICALLY
